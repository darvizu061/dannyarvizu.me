        <p>Eat Clean Chicago is a meal prep company that was ready to step outside of Squarespace and take full control of their e-commerce platform. I helped them accomplish this through configuring their semi-custom Wordpress website.</p>

      <p class="content-title">The Essential Updates</p>
      <p class="content-p">When I first took up Eat Clean Chicago as a client, I knew they had three major problems with thier pre-existing website. Their 3-page website lacked appealing design, it didn't allow for new customer acquisition via a sign-up page, and their business analytic tools were virtually non-existent.</p>
      <p class="content-title">The Solution & Site Migration</p>
      <p class="content-p">Working on a very tight budget and under a close deadline, the best solution for addressing a website lacking design and customer aquisiton ability was to switch the CMS to Wordpress. Doing so would allow me to purchase a third party Wordpress theme to fix the design issue, a cheap and time-saving solution. Furthermore, configuring the new Wordpress site and theme would facilitate the process of creating and configuring the signup page. After that, the only thing left to do was to transfer the database of products from their Squarespace site to their new Wordpress site hosted on GoDaddy.</p>

      <p class="content-title">The Power Of Woocommerce</p>
      <p class="content-p">One of the best reasons why any company should take full control of their e-commerce platform is for analytical insight on their customers, products, and services. Knowledge of what products/services are selling and to where your customer lands in terms of demographics is a highly effective tool for increasing business revenue. But ECC had no tools to obtain or track this business data. This is where WooCommerce, a WP plugin, came into play. After setting up WooCommerce, ECC now had analytical data on business revenue and product popularity. In addition, I set up Google Analytics to track site visitor data.</p>
